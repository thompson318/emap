/**
 * \brief Tracks the final history for each planned movement within the hospital.
 * <p>
 * Currently we don't get the id for a PND event from EPIC, which means that we try to match an update to an existing pending transfer
 * or a cancellation of one, but this only works if the location doesn't change during an update.
 * There is an open Sherlock to get a primary key added, which will allow us to always update the correct transfer.
